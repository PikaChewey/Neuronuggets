      <h2>A MIT&apos;s MITES Semester project</h2>

      <p>Every 33 seconds, someone loses their battle against heart disease. That&apos;s 1.8 million people a year; 1.8 million people who never chose their illness but had to face the consequences. By the time you are reading this sentence, heart disease has already claimed another victim&apos;s life.</p>

      <p>Currently, chronic heart disease (CHD) provides patients with three options: surgery, transplant, or death. It&apos;s estimated that 1 in 4 people will develop CHD in their lifetime, many of whom belong to a lower socioeconomic status. With heart surgery tearing a $60,000 hole in household earnings, and the transplant list providing a 10% chance of receiving a heart, researchers are looking for a better way to treat CHD. Even if you were lucky enough to score an organ off the transplant list, there&apos;s a 30% chance of organ rejection. Of these organ rejections, 10%-20% end in death. The financial burden of heart surgery and uprooting distress of an unsuccessful long wait on the transplant list further pushes many people into disparity, but this doesn&apos;t have to continue.</p>

      <p>If only we could treat heart disease without surgery or transplant.</p>

      <p>This is where retroviruses and stem cells (SCs) come in. A retrovirus, spherical and about 100 nanometers in diameter, latches onto a specific receptor on a SC&apos;s membrane. Here, the retrovirus&apos;s membrane fuses with the SC&apos;s membrane, pushing its internal contents inside. This retro-virus doesn&apos;t know it&apos;s paving a new way to battle against CHD. While the solution isn&apos;t an end-all fix-all, retrovirally induced pluripotent stem cells (RiPSCs) provide a promising future for heart health. Woah, those are some big words, let&apos;s back it up. SCs are cells in our body that have the ability to differentiate (divide) into any other cell. There are three types of SCs: Totipotent, Pluripotent, and Multipotent. This story occurs amongst the latter two. Pluripotent-SCs are cells only present when we are an embryo. These cells have the ability to become any cell in our body. What&apos;s so special about these cells though? Pluripotent-SCs are what allow embryos to quickly and correctly differentiate into all your cells within 9 months. They have the ability to heal and regenerate entire organs within 2–3 months! Multipotent-SCs are the majority SCs that are present in our body after birth. While our Multipotent-SCs do an excellent job creating scar tissue and healing fractures, they are not nearly as capable as Pluripotent-SCs. Multipotent-SCs are less efficient at differentiating, meaning they cannot heal or detect and repair damage as quickly and precisely as Pluripotent-SCs.</p>

      <p>If only our body still had pluripotent stem cells.</p>

      </figure>

      <p>While our body doesn&apos;t have any Pluripotent-SCs, we sure can make some. This is done via retro-viral induction. Retro-viral induction can be utilized to allow Multipotent-SCs to become Pluripotent-SCs; they can then efficiently detect and repair heart damage. So how does it work? Here&apos;s some background information to get us started. A retrovirus has the ability to insert any gene or protein into the host cell. Our DNA tells our cells what to do, but not every gene in our DNA is expressed. There are specific unexpressed genes in our DNA called Oct 3–4, Sox 2, Klf4, and c-Myc. While their names may sound confusing, these genes are responsible for telling a Multipotent-SC when to become a Pluripotent-SC. They are the first step in what will allow us to treat CHD non-surgically without breaking the bank. We do not have Pluripotent-SCs because their genes haven&apos;t been expressed, but specific proteins can help express these specific genes. The genes that code for Pluripotent-SCs can be expressed via proteins called Yamanaka factors. Do you recall how retroviruses have the ability to insert their genetic material into a host cell? We can remove the genetic material from the retrovirus, have it carry the Yamanaka factors instead, and let it insert these factors into the Multipotent-SC to express the genes that code for Pluripotent-SCs.</p>

      <p>So then why hasn&apos;t this been implicated into the health care system already?</p>

      <p>There&apos;s one main factor researchers are working on to make this technique applicable: epigenetics. If our genome (DNA) is an instruction manual, with every page being a gene, the epigenome is the clip that seals some of the pages shut, not allowing us to follow through with those instructions. The epigenome is composed of proteins, and the genome is wrapped very tightly around these proteins. Everyone&apos;s epigenome is different because it&apos;s affected by your current and ancestral environment, all of which impact genomic expression. &quot;So you kind of have this little tug of war…Some people&apos;s genes that should be turned on aren&apos;t…and some people&apos;s genes that need to be shut down aren&apos;t…&quot; explains Dr. Kenneth Eilertson, a professor at Pennington Biomedical Research Center. Due to this, every heart tissue generated through RiPSCs needs to be specialized to the patient&apos;s epigenome. This can take a while to develop at a quick enough rate for everyone to receive. For example, even if we express the Oct 3–4, Sox 2, Klf4, and c-Myc genes, the patient&apos;s epigenome could end up turning those genes off later in the future. Researchers are working on this problem by introducing nano-particles into the cell; these miniature hollow spheres would hold onto the Yamanaka factors and release them across the healing period for controlled gene expression.</p>

      <p>RiPSCs can regenerate into new heart cells, repairing coronary or artery damage; current efforts also allow these SCs to regenerate into a whole new heart. Heart issues have been heartlessly taking stability for far too long, but this technique will allow us to take back what&apos;s ours. By the time you&apos;ve read this, 11 people have already died of CHD- 11 people too many. We don&apos;t need expensive heart surgery or rejected organ transplants, we need answers. It&apos;s in our nature to search the highest limits and the lowest depths for these answers, but it&apos;s time we also search within us, because within us, lies the real answers: our stem cells.</p>
