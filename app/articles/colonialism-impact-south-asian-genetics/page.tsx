      <p>The Legacy of British colonialism in South Asia extends far beyond the political and economic turmoil, leaving a profound impact on the health and epigenetics of the population. Colonial policies and practices have contributed to the current epidemic of diabetes, obesity, and heart disease among South Asians-a direct link to epigenetic changes.</p>

      <p>The epigenome is the proteins surrounding your genome. Your genome is your DNA, it&apos;s like an instruction manual telling your cells how to behave. Your epigenome is like a paper clip, these paper clips seal certain pages shut, not allowing their instructions to be followed through by the cell. Everything in our body is controlled by our genes, including our metabolism, and how we store our fat. Since everything is controlled by our genes, we need to be able to regulate those genes-that&apos;s the epigenome&apos;s task.</p>

      <p>Now, let&apos;s put all that into context. Imagine you are a South Asian farmer. The local authority took away your season&apos;s harvest, leaving you starving for weeks. How would your body respond? Naturally, when we eat food, our body breaks it down into glucose to use as energy, and stores the extra as glycogen. This glycogen, during starvation, is then broken down for energy. When these glycogen stores run out, our body starts breaking itself down for energy, this causes a weakened immune system. During starvation, people who stored more glycogen were more likely to survive because they would have more stored energy and would not need to resort to breaking down their bodies.</p>

      <p>The process of breaking down and storing energy is controlled by our genes. The faster our metabolism, the faster we break down stored energy. During starvation, our epigenome manipulates gene expression to slow down metabolism and increase glycogen stores. This manipulated genome then gets passed down to the next generations, allowing a whole lineage to survive.</p>

      <p>So, we know the basics of how our body responds to starvation, but how is that a bad thing?</p>

      <p>This is when the story really begins.</p>

      <p>British colonial rule in South Asia, particularly in India, was marked by numerous famines, the most devastating being the Bengal Famine in 1943, which resulted in the deaths of up to three million people. Over the course of a century, India had more than 25 major famines, more than all of European history spread across multiple centuries. Nobel Prize-winning economist Amartya Sen has argued that these famines were not due to a lack of food, but rather the unequal distribution of resources, exacerbated by colonial policies. The East India Company&apos;s tax policies, resource allocation to the military, and British inaction during drought contributed significantly to the famines.</p>

      <p>Due to these famines, according to Dr. Mubin Syed, a radiologist and obesity medicine specialist, South Asians have a tendency to store fat and have low lean muscle mass as a result of being &quot;starvation adapted.&quot; While having slow metabolism, increased glycogen stores (fat), and lower muscle mass helped South Asians survive famines back then, it is hurting them in today&apos;s society. Even though these epigenetic changes are no longer favorable in a world where food is available at every corner, epigenetics are inherited and pass down through multiple generations. This adaptation has led to a higher propensity for metabolic disorders in subsequent generations.</p>

      <p>South Asians are significantly more likely to develop type 2 diabetes compared to other ethnic groups. Studies indicate that South Asians are four to six times more likely to develop type 2 diabetes than white Europeans. Research from Brown University suggests that surviving just one famine can double the risk of diabetes and obesity in the next generation. Imagine the impact of 25 famines!</p>

      <p>The prevalence of obesity in South Asia has also been rising, with significant health implications. South Asians tend to have a high percentage of body fat, particularly visceral fat, which is associated with a higher risk of metabolic diseases. This is because fat takes a longer time to break down, which can aid with famine survival. The MASALA (Mediators of Atherosclerosis in South Asians Living America) study found that South Asians had higher liver and intermuscular fat and low lean muscle mass compared to other ethnic groups. This adverse body composition is a direct consequence of the epigenetic changes triggered by historical famines.</p>

      <p>Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is another major health concern for South Asians. The National Lipid Association highlights that South Asians have a disproportionately greater burden of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, which often occurs earlier in life and is more aggressive. This combination of traditional risk factors, such as hypertension and diabetes, combined with unhealthy living conditions, contributes to the inequality South Asians face in heart health.</p>

      <p>The impact of British colonialism on South Asian health is an ongoing and multifaceted struggle. The historical famines and subsequent epigenetic changes have left a lasting legacy, contributing to the high prevalence of diabetes, obesity, and cardiovascular disease. Understanding these connections is essential for developing effective public health strategies and interventions tailored to the unique needs of the South Asian population. Many chronic diseases have a root in historical strife and consequent epigenetic changes, acknowledging the impact of these events can give us a better picture of the impacts of colonialism.</p>
